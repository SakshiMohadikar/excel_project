Project Objective 

The objective of the project is to analyze a car dataset to identify key factors for potential car models to be launched. 
Extract actionable insights from the given data; focusing on key areas such as new product development, innovation, competitive analysis; or benchmarking. 
Utilize the analytical skills acquired in previous sprints for this project, employing Excel as needed for the analysis requirements. 
The objective of this is to clean the dataset (if required), perform the project tasks to identify the potential model; and present insights about the most diverse car 
manufacturer in the given country. 

*PROJECT 1*
Task 1 
Identify the top 10 cars with the highest miles per gallon. Also, identify the names of the car manufacturers. 

Task 2 
Identify the top 10 cars with the highest miles per gallon based on displacement. Also, identify the names of their car manufacturers.  

Task 3 
Identify the top 3 manufacturers with the highest number of cars of the hatchback body type. 

Task 4 
Compare the mileages of cars produced by all manufacturers and perform outlier analysis. 

Task 5 
Present the relationship between: 
(a) displacement and mileage 
(b) mileage and fuel tank capacity 
We may consider either city mileage or highway mileage 

Task 6 
Identify a car that would be best for adventurous drives. 
Considering the following areas for analysis: car size, engine 
power, safety features like traction control; and ground 
clearance. Based on these areas, infer the correct columns 
in the data for analysis. 

Task 7 
A person choosing a car for family usage may consider the following areas for analysis. 
1. Car size 
2. Safety features for adults and children 
3_ Mileage 
4_ Comfort during long distance travel 
5_ Built-in entertainment options 
Using the columns above, identify a car suitable 
for family usage. 

Task 8 
The car manufacturer decides to launch two types of cars. 
1. Compact city car (primarily for city usage) 
2. Family car (primarily for long distance travel) 
Identify the potential competitor cars for the two types of cars 
stated above. 

Task 9 
Identify the outliers from following columns using Histogram 
method _ 
1 _ Displacement(Bin Size=980) 
2_ City Size=0_88) 
3_ Fuel Tank_Capacity(Bin Size=3) 
Remove the identified outliers from the dataset 

Task 10 
Identify the top three car manufacturers with the highest number of variants in the hatchback category. 
Identify the top three manufacturers With the highest number of variants in the sedan category. 
Identify the top three manufacturers with the highest number of variants in the SUV category. 



*PROJECT 2*
Task 1 
Identify the top two manufacturers who offer the widest range of cars variants. Use appropriate charts/graphs to present the output, capturing the number of car variants under each body type for the two manufacturers identified above. 


Task 2 
Calculate and compare variations between City Mileage data using different measures of dispersion of the following three manufacturers. 
1 Tata 
2. Maruti Suzuki 
3. Hyundai 
Which manufacturer offers the widest variation of city mileage? 


Task 3 
a. Display and check how City Mileage depends on Fuel Tank_Capacity using scatter plot along with trend line and Pearson's product-moment coefficient(R)_ 
b. Display and check how Displacement depends on Fuel Tank_Capacity using scatter plot along with trend line and Pearson's product-moment 
coefficient(R)_ 


Understanding the Driving Patterns :
Let's narrow down the analysis by observing fuel efficiency to understand driving patterns which will further help identify opportunities for reducing carbon emissions. This will involve another round of data pre-processing and performing a few more additional tasks. 

Task 4: Data Preprocessing 
A) Import the car dataset into Excel. 
B) Clean and format the data. 
a) Check for missing values and inconsistencies. 
b) Convert categorical variables to numerical codes 
(e.g., 1 _ CNG, 2. Petrol for fuel types etc). 
c) Standardize the units. 

Task 4: Data Preprocessing (cont'd) 
C) Calculate additional fuel efficiency metrics: 
a) Combine city and highway mileage into a weighted average based on typical driving patterns. 
[Formula: Avg. Combined Mileage = (City Mileage + 
Highway_Mileage)/21 
b) Calculate distances driven from the data of combined city_highway mileage and fuel tank capacity. 
[Formula: Distance = (Fuel Tank 
Capacity * Avg Combined Mileage)] 


Task 5 â€” Data Analysis 
A) Visualize fuel efficiency distribution: Compare fuel efficiency across car makes, models, fuel types, and other relevant features using a bar chart. 

B) Analyze driving patterns: 
a) Plot average speeds and distances driven against fuel efficiency to identify trends. 
b) Use scatterplots and correlation matrices to explore relationships between fuel efficiency and other variables 

C) Identifying Opportunities for Reduced Emissions: Group cars by fuel efficiency: 
a) Segment cars into categories like "high efficiency,", "moderate efficiency," and "low efficiency." 
b) Analyze the distribution of features within each category. 
c) Identify common characteristics of cars with high fuel efficiency. 

Task 6 
Customize and enhance charts/graphs with appropriate story telling. 
Integrate necessary and relevant charts/graphs aligned with business objectives into dashboards to present the analyses.
